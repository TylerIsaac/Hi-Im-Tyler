            <h3>About Tyler</h3>
              <p class="wrapper">I graduated college with a major in Business Administration and a minor in Computer Science. After working a few years at AT&T in a sales consultant role I realized my true passion is for software development. So I decided to dive back in and grow my knowledge in software development, as well as collaborate and learn form others in the software development community.</p>

              <p class="wrapper">Outside of software development I enjoy music production and one day I would love to put my knowledge to the test and develop my own VST (virtual instrument). I also enjoy watching sports, especially NFL football on Sundays.</p>
              <!--i put my bio inside of an article container because I figured it would translate easily to my other pages such as (GitHub and Linkdin) -->
